                    <li>
                        <b>C - Contrast: </b>
                        The contrast of Arngen's website is not good. Most of the fonts in the main section (except for the website's title) are all about the same size and it's
                        a bit hard to tell what to look at. As for the color, there are so many colors being used that it does not look consistent in the page design.
                        There are many shapes (mostly rectangles and squares) being used to border some of the items' pictures, that it blends in with the rest of the other items
                        and doesn't stand out. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>R - Repetition: </b>
                        The way the categories are displayed on the left side are easy to distinguish by since the navigation seems more user-friendly. However, the items displayed
                        in the middle of the webite are not repetitive. They're just all over the place and very distracting. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>A - Alignment: </b>
                        The alignment on this website is also bad, except for the part where the categories are nicely organized on the left side of the page. All of the images
                        displayed in the page are scattered all over the place, making it hard to distinguish what information goes with which item.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>P - Proximity: </b>
                        The proximity of all the items displayed and listed on this website are also bad. Eveything is close together and there isn't really a clear separation
                        between most of the items. Due to the lack of spacing, it makes the website hard to read and navigate through. It also don't seem user-friendly.

                <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/"></a>Apple</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>C - Contrast: </b>
                        Apple's contrast on their website is very good. Newer phones are grouped together at the top and other products are grouped together below in smaller 
                        squares and large rectangles. The background and font colors with this style of grouping, it makes it easier to find products and navigate through the website.
