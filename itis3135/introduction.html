        <p><b>Hi, my name is Vanita and I am a junior majoring in computer science at UNC Charlotte. My concentration is web/app development & software engineering. I’m from Fort Mill, SC, but I was originally born near Detroit, MI.</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Personal Background:</b> In my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends, exploring the city, trying different cuisines, and practicing martial arts.</li>

            <li><b>Professional Background:</b> My computer science background began in sixth grade, and I started out learning HTML and CSS. Since then, I’ve completed online courses and certificates as well as projects which include languages such as JavaScript, Java, and Python. So far, I have interned at a start-up company called Comet, a college task applications manager, as a student flight test intern from July 2022 to September 2022.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><b>Academic Background:</b> I am a second-year student at UNC Charlotte, pursuing a major in computer science with a focus on software engineering & web/app development. In my junior and senior year of high school, I took dual enrollment courses at the University of South Carolina at Lancaster.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><b>Primary Computer:</b> Apple, MacOS, MacBook Air Laptop, Dorm</li>

                    <li><b>MATH 1242 - Calculus II:</b> This is a requirement for computer science majors.</li>
                    <li><b>ITSC 3146 - Intro Oper Syst & Networking:</b> I was informed that this course will be very helpful if I would like to pursue a career in software engineering.</li>
                    <li><b>ITIS 3135 - Front-End Web App Development:</b> I have completed a course similar to this online during the pandemic and I enjoyed it. I also thought it would be a good idea to refresh my memory on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</li>
                    <li><b>ITSC 2175 - Logic and Algorithms:</b> This was another course I was told will be very helpful for aspiring software engineers.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
