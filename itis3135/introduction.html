        <p>I’m a junior at UNC Charlotte studying Computer Science with a focus in Software Engineering & Web/App Development. I am eager to further develop my skills and knowledge in front-end development this semester.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Personal Background: </b>I’ve lived in the Carolinas for most of my life, but I was originally born in Michigan. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends, exploring the city, trying different cuisines, and practicing martial arts.</li>
            <li><b>Professional Background: </b>Throughout my time here at UNC Charlotte, I’ve worked on several projects–both course-based and personal–involving programming languages such as Java, Python, JavaScript, and HTML. I am hoping to obtain a front-end software engineering internship/position by the time I graduate.</li>
            <li><b>Academic Background: </b>I’m currently a junior studying Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering & Web/App Development. Before coming here to UNC Charlotte, I attended a high school in Indian Land, South Carolina.</li>
            <li><b>Background in this Subject: </b>In 2020, during the pandemic, I participated in an online coding academy where I focused on working on front-end web development and completed multiple projects involving HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
            <li><b>Primary Work Computer: </b>The laptop I primarily use for university assignments is a MacBook Air M3 14-inch. I also have a Microsoft Surface Pro 7+ laptop.</li>
            <li><b>Backup Work Computer & Location Plan: </b>If I cannot use either of those laptops, I will visit Atkins library and use one of their computers.</li>
            
            <li><b>Courses I'm Taking, & Why: </b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>MATH1242 - Calculus II: </b>It's a required class.</li>
                    <li><b>ITIS3135 - Front-end Web Application Development: </b>A required class, but it’s also an interesting one since it’s an area of software engineering that I would like to go into.</li>
                    <li><b>ITSC3155 - Software Engineering: </b>An interesting class since it relates to the job I would like to obtain one day.</li>
                    <li><b>ITCS3050 - Technical Interview Prep 101: </b>Another interesting class since it’s something I believe would help me become successful in future interviews.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><b>Funny/Interesting item to remember me by: </b>I'm a 2nd-degree black belt in American Freestyle Karate.</li>
            <li><b>I'd also like to share: </b>I was born near Detroit.</li>
        </ul>
