            <p class="evaluations">
                Starting off with contrast, the contrast of Arngen's website is terrible. The title and categories stand out,
                but the many items listed are hard to distinguish from since everything looks very similar and are all over the place.
                <br><br />
                As for repetition, the way the categories are displayed on the left side are easy to distinguish by since the 
                navigation seems more user-friendly. However, the items displayed in the middle of the page aren't repetitive and is 
                very distracting since once again, everything is all over the place. It's just hard to read in general.
                <br><br />
                Moving on to alignment, there isn't any alignment in the page at all besides the categories section.
                All images are scattered all over the place making it hard to figure out what information goes with what image.
                Also, there are images covering some text which can cause an issue with users finding the information that goes 
                to each image.
                <br><br />
                Last but not least, proximity. Everything is way too close together and there isn't any clear separation between items. 
                Due to the lack of spacing, the website is overall hard to navigate and isn't user-friendly at all.

        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple</a></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>C - Contrast</li>
                <li>R - Repetition</li>
                <li>A - Alignment</li>
                <li>P - Proximity</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="evaluations">
                Starting off once again with contrast, Apple's contrast in their website is very good. Newer phones are grouped together
                at the top and other products are grouped together below in smaller squares, thus making each group stand out and look visually 
                appealing.
                <br><br />
                Next, for repetition, the same groups that were mentioned above use consistent elements that are similar. For example,
                the new phones grouped at the top of the page all use big squares/rectangles that take up the whole width of the page.
                The other products grouped below them all use smaller squares with one square on the left and the other on the right.
                These groups both use some type of repetition in the website that make it look consistent and user-friendly.
                <br><br />
                Thirdly, the alignment of texts in the page are all centered--except for the ones at the bottom of the page--and don't have 
                a mix of different alignments. It's very consistent in it's alignment for each product in the squares to represent each 
                important piece of information.
                <br><br  />
                Lastly, the proximity of each element in the page is very good. Nothing is too close together and products that are different
                are kept apart using squares. There are also clear separations present that make it easy to navigate Apple's website.
